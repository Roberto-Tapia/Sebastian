## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, MJML

My client needed to collect data from clients. Clients would input data on a form, and that data would then be inserted into an email to be sent out. At first, I started using tables to format the email templates. This allowed me to create a clear structure that organized the data in a logical way. However, I soon found that unless using a responsive template, designing an e-mail from scratch requires extensive knowledge of special cases and ghost tables to make it responsive.

That's when I discovered MJML, a markup language specifically designed for responsive email templates. With MJML, I was able to create email templates that were not only clean and organized, but also visually appealing and easy to read on any device.

By using tables and then transitioning to MJML, I was able to provide my client with a solution that met their needs and exceeded their expectations. The resulting email templates were both practical and visually appealing, and my client was thrilled with the results.

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews! -->

## Lessons Learned:

For this project I learned about tables, and in-line CSS. I found out the requirements needed to make e-mails responsive, and opted for MJML which makes designing responsive e-mails a breeze. I re-learned in-line CSS and learned about its limitations. I learned how to use MJML syntax.
